# ocppws / ocpp C++
OCPPws is a C++ implementation of the Open Charge Point Protocol.

It uses libwebsocket, a lighweight websocket C library for websocket management. It is currently under development only supporting Boot, Heartbeat and StatusNotification messages.

Any advice or comment is accepted with a smile :), I'm currently learning.
