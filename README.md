# ocppws / ocpp C++ / ocpp cpp
OCPPws is a C++ implementation of the Open Charge Point Protocol.

It uses libwebsocket, a lighweight websocket C library for websocket management. **It is currently under development only supporting server mode** with Boot, Heartbeat, status, metervalue, start-stop transactions, authorize.

Any advice or comment is accepted with a smile :), I'm currently learning.
